# Knowledge Graph-Powered Movie Recommendation System with LLM Integration
"Developed and implemented a Knowledge Graph-powered platform for movie data, transforming raw tabular information into a semantically rich network using Neo4j. Designed and populated a graph schema connecting Movies, Persons (Actors/Directors), Characters, Genres, and Keywords, enabling complex relationship-based insights. Integrated an OpenAI Large Language Model (LLM) via LangChain's GraphCypherQAChain to facilitate natural language querying, allowing users to ask intricate questions (e.g., 'What comedy movies star Tom Hanks?') which are converted to Cypher, executed on the graph, and returned as human-readable answers. Deployed functionality as a scalable FastAPI web service, enhancing content recommendation capabilities through deep contextual understanding and intuitive access to interconnected data."
